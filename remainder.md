What we have so far:

- Randomized terrain values
- Islands and water
- Full First-Person camera movement
- Customizable landscape size

What still needs to be done:

- Flying Critters (Butterflies and Boids)
- Plants and rocks
- Skybox and camera limiting (to keep it from going underneath the terrain or outside the skybox)
- Lighting
